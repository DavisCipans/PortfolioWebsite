            <p class="caseText">
                Established in 2013, OrderYOYO is a white label, startup company that provides restaurants and takeaways with their own takeaway
                system platform. OrderYOYO provides restaurant with a web page, and apps both for Android and Apple devices,
                allowing consumers to order directly from restaurant through an app or a website with no extra charges.

            Old website:
            <small class="text-muted">Research and discovery.</small>
        </h3>
        <p class="caseText">
            Trough user interviews and think aloud tests while using the website, we were able to determine problems to an existing website
            and reasons why people would sign up for the project and discover flaws that would deter them from engaging with
            the company.</p>
        <p class="caseText">Not only the content was important to people, but also overall look of the website, the design language and color
            usage. That would all highly contribute to the trustworthiness factor.

        </h3>
        <p class="caseText">
            To acknowledge benefits and pros that potential customers would receive from signing up for OrderYOYO’s product, we conducted
            interviews with current customers and did market research. Interviewing existing customers helped us understand
            better the benefits they truly cared about and the ones we should showcase. And they gave additional time to
            gather feedback to continually improve the product itself. Win-win situation!</p>
        <p class="caseText">Competitor research was done in order to understand what information and features are commonly showcased, how other
            companies had tackled the problem of structuring their content. And how they would pursue potential customers
            to sign up for services they offer.

        <p class="lead borderText">
            <strong>Based on our research, conclusions were made to keep OrderYOYO’s website simple.
                <br>Efficiently show features that the company offers and familiarize potential customers with the company and
                to create welcoming and positive image.

            Designing a new website:
            <small class="text-muted">Creating a visual identity.</small>
        </h3>
        <p class="caseText">
            Whilst company had logo, there was no uniting visual identity to send a clear message. Part of my job when designing a website
            was creating a visual identity that would portray OrderYOYO as trustworthy, serious and businesslike company
            for customers. While retaining peaceful and kind image. That was done by using already established YOYO Green
            color and additional ocean-dark shade of blue.
        </p>
        <h3>
            User centered:
            <small class="text-muted">User friendly website</small>
        </h3>
        <p class="caseText">
            To create efficient dialogue between the company and users, website had to be simple to use and had to display clearly understandable
            information. To achieve that User-centered design framework of process was used. Where trough vigorous prototyping
            and user testing cycles we were able to come up with design that would achieve the goals we set.
        </p>
        <p class="caseText">
            <em>Quick win</em> features were implemented on the old website, while new one was being developed. Like Support
            chat plugin, that would allow both customers of OrderYOYO and restaurant platform customers to reach OrderYOYO’s
            support much quicker and easier.
