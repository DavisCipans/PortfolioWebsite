            <p class="caseText">
                Established in 2013, OrderYOYO is a white label, startup company that provides restaurants and takeaways with their own takeaway
                system platform. OrderYOYO provides restaurant with a web page, and apps both for Android and Apple devices,
                allowing consumers to order directly from restaurant through an app or a website with no extra charges.

        </h3>
        <p class="caseText">
            Initial research was made to point out flaws of current website. Trough user interviews and think aloud tests while using
            the website, we were able to determine problems to an existing website and reasons why people would sign up for
            the project and discover flaws that would deter them from engaging with the company. Point of research was to
            understand how people perceive displayed information on the website. What associations were made and how likely
            would they trust a brand from the website alone.</p>
        <p class="caseText">We discovered that not only the content was important to people, but also overall look of the website, the design
            language and color usage. That would all highly contribute to the trustworthiness factor.

        <p class="caseText">
            To acknowledge benefits and pros that potential customers would receive from signing up for OrderYOYO’s product, we conducted
            interviews with current customers and did market research. Interviewing existing customers helped us understand
            better the benefits they truly cared about and the ones we should showcase. And they gave additional time to
            gather feedback to continually improve the product itself. Win-win situation!</p>
        <p class="caseText">Competitor research was done in order to understand what information and features are commonly showcased, how other
            companies had tackled the problem of structuring their content. And how they would pursue potential customers
            to sign up for services they offer.

        </p>
        <p class="caseText">Trough competitor research and user surveys we came to conclusion on what should be displayed on the homepage. We
            wanted people to understand the advantages of OrderYOYO’s product over others, what would potential customers
            gain, ease them into the sign-up process and familiarize them with the company. Sending the right message was
            goal number one.

            <strong>Based on our research, conclusions were made to keep OrderYOYO’s website simple.

            Designing a new website:

        </h3>
        <p class="caseText">
            Whilst company had logo, there was no uniting visual identity to send a clear message. Part of my job when designing a website
            was creating a uniting and consistent visual identity that would portray OrderYOYO as trustworthy, serious and
            business orientated company for customers. While retaining peaceful and kind image. That was done by using already
            established YOYO Green color and additional ocean-dark shade of blue.

            To create efficient dialogue between the company and users, website had to be simple to use and had to display clearly understandable
            information. While developing UI, high attention was focused on creating a design with User-centered design framework
            of process. It is a multi-stage problem-solving process that required us to analyze and think of ways that the
            potential customer would interact with the product. Largely based on user-testing their behaviours while using
            the website trough many prototype versions.

        <p class="caseText">
            Point was also made at integrating elements of persuasive design. Call-to-action buttons, adding testimonials and keeping
            friendly language style. Our aim was to persuade people through our friendliness, confidence and facts to make
            them sign up for OrderYOYO’s product.
