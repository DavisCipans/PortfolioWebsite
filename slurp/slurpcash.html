            The problem:
            <small class="text-muted">Too much pen and paper.</small>
        </h3>
        <p class="caseText">
            During busy hours in a restaurant, staffs attention must be devoted fully to their customers. Unfortunately there are times
            when some ingredients are missing and somebody has to pick up more from the local shop. After doing so the receipts
            have to be saved and noted down on a piece of paper. </p>
        <p class="caseText">But not always the paper nor the receipt is kept safe until the end of the work day. And when the cash register is
            checked - problems arise!
        </p>
        <h3>
            Saving receipts:
            <small class="text-muted">Saving time.</small>
        </h3>
        <p class="caseText">
            My goal was to design a flow that would allow restaurant’s staff to efficiently and quickly note down receipts and save them
            in the system.</p>
        <p class="caseText">Initial wireframes were provided from a client with a vision and requirements of what the digital product should
            contain. Initially two screens were proposed, one for receipt and one for cashier management.
        </p>

        <h3>
            More screens:
            <small class="text-muted">Less confusion.</small>
        </h3>
        <p class="caseText">
            Based on the structure of the information that needed to be saved from the receipts, I created a one requirement per screen
            system. That allowed users to easily focus on the receipt registration during a busy day in the restaurant, and
            made sure that the staff members would insert the correct information in the correct fields.
        </p>
        <p class="caseText">
            To maintain speed and quick registration, “Recent” and “Favourite” features were designed and implemented. That meant that
            staff would not have to type in the location or type of purchase if they have been made in the past. Thus saving
            valuable seconds that could be spent serving delicious ramen to customers.

            Dealing with numbers:

        </h3>
        <p class="caseText">
            By the end of the work day all the money has to be counted and registered. Along with a design for cashier management screen
            that displayed cashiers status based on the previous day information and registered receipts + generated income
            from sales. I designed a calculator that would ease the process of calculating remaining cash in the cashier.
        </p>
        <p class="caseText">
            I designed a currency calculator where restaurant’s staff member would not have to count the amount of money, but only the
            amount of coins and bills present. Application will count the rest and input the correct amount automatically.
            That way limiting the possible error from calculating with pen and paper and making the process more easier and
            streamlined.

                Light-weight mobile applications are taking over digital product market. And they can be used not only for entertainment
                purposes but also to contribute to working people and make their jobs easier.
            </p>
            <p class="caseText">
                By designing an app that would relieve restaurant’s staff from extra time and stress with dealing with numbers. We allow
                them to spend more time focusing on restaurant clients. Happier staff, satisfied customers and no more lost
                receipts, and errors while calculating cash at the end of the day.
